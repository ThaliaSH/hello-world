# hello-world
This is basically just an attempt to figure out how to navigate github. 

Okay, so my name is Thalia and I am a computer engineering student.  I work in a research lab at Brigham Young University.  
I don't know what else to put, without totally embarrasing myself and losing any potentiality of getting a job. Ever.

Therefore, toodles!
